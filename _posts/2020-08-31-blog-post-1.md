The basic idea behind a survival model is simple: predict the elapsed time until a certain event happens (most commonly the death of a something or someone, but it could also be a customer abonding the company for example) dependent on a set of covariates. The caveat here is also the reason why a generic regression model is not sufficient here: there is a good chance that the respective event does not occur during the observational period. This is usually called censoring.
